By the end of 2022, Baidu has open sourced more than 1,000 projects with more than 20,000 community contributors, with technologies covering a wide range of fields such as machine learning, autonomous driving, blockchain, data storage, edge computing, big front-end, security, and more. In particular, open source projects such as Flying Paddle, PaddlePaddle, Apollo, and XuprChain have become leading technology platforms in the industry, attracting more and more developers to participate in them. The successful practice of these open source projects not only promotes the improvement of Baidu's own technology, but also makes positive contributions to the global open source community.

Baidu is also a member of the Linux Foundation, Apache Software Foundation, CNCF Foundation, and Open Atomics Open Source Foundation. Baidu's ECharts, Doris, bRPC, Baetyl, BFE and other ten projects have been donated to the Foundation for incubation, among which Apache ECharts, Apache Doris, and Apache bRPC have graduated and become the top projects of the Foundation.

As a leading technology company in China, Baidu will **share a number of exciting topics** during the two-day GOTC conference, showcasing its latest achievements and research progress in cutting-edge technology fields** such as **AI, autonomous driving, blockchain, cloud native, graph database, and so on, in front of a large number of industry elites and technology enthusiasts.

**Main Forum**

**Keynote Speech:** Big Models Open New Era of AI

**Speaker:** Hou Zhenyu | Vice President, Baidu Group

**Topic Forum:**eBPF

**Topic:** eBPF Technology Practice in Cloud Native Domain

**Topic Forums:** **Web3** **Meta-Universe** **Worlds**

**Topic:** Distributed Instant Messaging Infrastructure Practice and Application Based on Blockchain

**Speaker:** Jingbo | Deputy General Manager and Head of Technology, Baidu Blockchain

**Issue: **The blockchain-based Web3 community is jointly owned by creators and co-builders. The community is no longer controlled by a single platform, and the platform no longer has the ability to receive dividends from a well-run community that do not match its contribution. At the same time, community co-builders can independently choose their own service providers. If the server where the community is located no longer provides services one day, users can vote to automate the migration of the entire community data and code to other service providers, so that the community, which has condensed the co-builders' efforts in operating the community, will continue to exist and run.
